# XLSX TO CSV Parser â€“ Parse and convert your Excel files into .CSV's


XLSX TO CSV Parser is an **Electron application** that provides conversion and parsing functionalities to transform an Excel .xlsx file into a .csv file. It allows you to parse files and perform date fetching and string parsing operations on the data contained in them.

For more information about Electron usage see the official documentation [here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/).

### Features

- Direct download of the parsed file
- Fullscreen mode
- Cross platform

## Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v.8.0.0^;
* You have installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/);

## Getting started
Clone the repository
```
git clone 
```
Install all dependencies
```
cd parser
npm install
```
### Run Locally
To start Parser in development mode, run the following command:
```
npm start
```
This will launch the application and open the main window.

### Create App Package

If you run the make script, Electron Forge will generate you platform specific distributables for you to share with everyone. 

```
npm run make
```

## Scripts Table

| ```start```  |   Launches the Electron application using Electron Forge. |
|---|---|
|  ```package``` |   Packages the application using Electron Forge. |
|  ```make``` | Creates distributable installers for the application using Electron Forge. |
|   ```publish```|  Publishes the packaged application using Electron Forge. |

### Roadmap of the App-Logic Development

- We've started by building the app from scratch using the basic input-I/O structure and drawing on it the key phases of the conversion we had to perform on those files.
![img-roadmap](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/8237/XYji8W.jpg)

- We so initially developed a Node.js script executed on the terminal CLI.
The code snippet performed the conversion action on the whole input path directory and retrieved as output the matching csv file for each parsed xlsx.
Here's the sample of the initial snippet.
```js
const readXlsxFile = require("read-excel-file/node");
const Papa = require("papaparse");
const moment = require("moment");
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");
const { program } = require("commander");
const glob = require("glob");

program
  .option("-i, --input <string>")
  .option("-o, --output <string>");

program.parse();

const options = program.opts();
const { input, output } = options;

const inputFolderPath = path.resolve(__dirname, input);
const outputFolderPath = path.resolve(__dirname, output);

const convertXlsxToCsv = (xlsxFilePath) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    readXlsxFile(xlsxFilePath)
      .then((rows) => {
        const firstRow = rows[0];
        const isDobField = firstRow.includes('data_di_nascita');
        console.log(firstRow);
        console.log(isDobField);

        const newFile = rows.map((row, index) => {
          if (!isDobField) return row;
          if (index === 0) return row;

          let dob = row[firstRow.indexOf('data_di_nascita')];
          console.log(dob);
          if (dob) {
            const date = moment(dob).format("DD/MM/YYYY");
            console.log(date);
            return [...row, date];
          }
          return row;
        }).filter((i) => i);

        const jsonFile = JSON.stringify(newFile);
        const csvFile = Papa.unparse(jsonFile);

        const xlsxFileName = path.basename(xlsxFilePath, ".xlsx");
        const csvFilePath = path.join(outputFolderPath, `${xlsxFileName}.csv`);

        fs.writeFile(csvFilePath, csvFile, "utf8", (error) => {
          if (error) {
            reject(`Error writing CSV file: ${error}`);
          } else {
            const rowsCount = rows.length - 1;
            resolve({ xlsxFilePath, csvFilePath, rowsCount });
          }
        });
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        reject(`Error reading Excel file: ${error}`);
      });
  });
};

const convertXlsxFilesInFolder = (folderPath) => {
  const xlsxFilesPattern = path.join(folderPath, "*.xlsx");
  glob(xlsxFilesPattern, (error, xlsxFiles) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error("Error finding XLSX files:", error);
      process.exit(1);
    }
    const convertPromises = xlsxFiles.map((xlsxFilePath) =>
      convertXlsxToCsv(xlsxFilePath)
    );
    Promise.all(convertPromises)
      .then((results) => {
        console.log("Conversion completed successfully!");
        results.forEach(({ xlsxFilePath, csvFilePath, rowsCount }) => {
          console.log({
            xlsxFilePath,
            csvFilePath,
            rowsCount,
          });
        });
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error("An error occurred during conversion:", error);
      });
  });
};

convertXlsxFilesInFolder(inputFolderPath);

```
 
- Although the working code, we had to keep in mind that we needed to build something more approachable for non-tech users. So, as we were considering a web application running both client and server side, and we instantly encountered the issue of letting communicate the core (server) and the gui (client), Salvatore tought about Electron and suggested it as a possible framework to use that was capable of building a cross-platform app runnung on a browser window.

- We started building the app, leveraging on the basic structure of an *Electron Forge* boilerplate. Then, as we checked the code was running clean, we refactored based on the **SOLID principles for Software Development** it and published the first version of our app.
